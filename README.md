# 🚗 ANPRSYS - Automatic Number Plate Recognition System

## 📌 Overview  
**Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** is an advanced technology that utilizes computer vision and machine learning to detect, recognize, and extract vehicle license plates from images or video streams. It plays a vital role in:  

✅ **Traffic Management** – Monitoring traffic flow, identifying rule violations, and reducing congestion.  
✅ **Law Enforcement** – Identifying stolen vehicles, tracking suspects, and enhancing public safety.  
✅ **Parking Management** – Automating parking lots, access control, and fee collection.  
✅ **Toll Collection** – Enabling fast, automated toll transactions without manual intervention.  
✅ **Border Security** – Identifying and monitoring vehicles crossing international borders.

## 🛠️ System Requirements  

To ensure smooth execution of the ANPR system, you need the following dependencies installed:

### **🔧 Software Requirements**  
1️⃣ **Python (any version)** – Core programming language for the ANPR system.  
2️⃣ **Anaconda (optional)** – Manages environments and dependencies efficiently.  
3️⃣ **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive coding and debugging environment.  
4️⃣ **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** – Alternative IDE for development.  

### **🖥️ Machine Learning & Deep Learning Requirements**  
5️⃣ **PyTorch** – Deep learning framework for training and inference.  
6️⃣ **YOLOv8 by Ultralytics** – Object detection model for number plate recognition.  
7️⃣ **EasyOCR** – Optical character recognition (OCR) for extracting text from plates.  
8️⃣ **CUDA/cuDNN (Optional, for GPU acceleration)** – Required for faster deep learning model execution.  

**💡 Note:** GPU acceleration is recommended for training large datasets but not mandatory for inference.
